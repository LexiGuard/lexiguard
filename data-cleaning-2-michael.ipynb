Test me in this,\" says the Lord All-Powerful. \"I will open the windows of heaven for you and pour out all the blessings you need\" \\nMatthew 25:14–30: the Parable of the talents\\nJohn 10:10: \"I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly\" \\nPhilippians 4:19: \"My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus\" \\n Prosperity theology casts itself as the reclamation of true doctrine and thus part of a path to Christian dominion over secular society  Prosperity churches place a strong emphasis on the importance of giving\n",

              "70    \"....folks are either incredibly inept....\" Actually, as everyone should know, the police are adept at only one thing, cleaning up the carnage after the act. My \"primary\" point in my OP and responses is, that people, willy nilly, drawing their weapons without recognition of a \"clear and present danger\" is NOT anything any responsible self-defense agency would be teaching about an \"active shooter\" situation. Too many people think by going armed they are \"prepared,\" NOT! I have over 55 years experience with firearms, 20 of those in the Marine Corps, some in armed security. Anywhere I am & some \"active shooter\" emerges, my 1st response is to assess my/our endangerment, not immediate, I seek to exit, if an exit is not available, I will be seeking cover/concealment, I WILL NOT have a weapon exposed unless I/mine are in IMMEDIATE danger! There are a myriad other elements that anybody thinking to go ARMED should have knowledge of. Start on Youtube and search DHS Active Shooter.\n",
